# üîê File Encryption CLI Tool

A command-line Python utility for **secure file encryption and decryption** using the `cryptography` library‚Äôs `Fernet` symmetric encryption algorithm.  
The tool ensures confidentiality and integrity of your data with simple menu-driven interaction.

---

##  Overview
This project demonstrates the practical use of **symmetric key cryptography** in Python.  
It allows users to:
- Generate and persist encryption keys securely.
- Encrypt and decrypt files of any type.
- Interact via a robust and user-friendly CLI with error handling.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

###  Encryption Algorithm
The project uses **Fernet** from the `cryptography` library.  
Fernet guarantees:
- **AES in CBC mode with a 128-bit key**
- **PKCS7 padding**
- **HMAC (SHA256)** for message authentication  
This means each encrypted file is **authenticated and tamper-proof**.

###  Key Management
- The key is generated **once** and saved locally as `secret.key`.
- If the file exists, it‚Äôs reused ‚Äî avoiding accidental key overwrites.
- The same key must be used to decrypt files that were encrypted with it.

##  Code Structure

| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `encryption_tool.py` | Main script containing all core functions and CLI logic |
| `secret.key` | Binary file storing the symmetric encryption key (auto-generated) |

---

##  Features
‚úÖ Generate and persist symmetric encryption keys  
‚úÖ Encrypt and decrypt any file type (text, CSV, PDF, etc.)  
‚úÖ Robust error handling for missing or invalid files  
‚úÖ Simple and interactive command-line menu  
‚úÖ Prevents accidental key regeneration

##  Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/file-encryption-cli.git
cd file-encryption-cli
```
### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install cryptography
```

### Usage

Run the script:

python encryption_tool.py

You‚Äôll see a simple interactive menu:

=====================================
1. Encrypt a file
2. Decrypt a file
3. Exit
=====================================

Example workflow:

-Choose Encrypt a file

-Enter the filename (e.g., data.csv)

-The file will be encrypted using Fernet and overwritten with ciphertext.

-Choose Decrypt a file to restore it to plaintext.

### Important Notes

-Do not delete secret.key, or you won‚Äôt be able to decrypt your files.

-Each key is unique; files encrypted with one key cannot be decrypted with another.

-The script encrypts files in-place, so consider backing up original data.

### Future Improvements

-Add support for multiple keys or password-based key derivation (PBKDF2)

-Option to specify output directory instead of overwriting

-File integrity verification logs

-Unit testing with pytest
